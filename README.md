# Optimization Exercises

This repository contains three assignments from the Optimization course.  
Each folder includes the original report (PDF) and submitted source/archive files.

## Contents
- [Homework 1](./Homework%201/)  
  - Stationary-point analysis and Hessian-based classification for a non-linear bivariate function  
  - Linear map analysis: eigenvalues/eigenvectors, diagonalization, and quadratic-form definiteness  
  - Convexity topics (e.g., |x| and binary cross-entropy)  
  - Quadratic-fit line search (implementation & discussion)

- [Homework 2](./Homework%202/)  
  - Nonlinear least squares: **rotated ellipse fitting** with analytic Jacobian  
  - Solver comparison: **Gauss–Newton vs. Levenberg–Marquardt** (iterations, loss, conditioning)  
  - Metaheuristics: **PSO** on a multimodal “Dolphin” function (trials, noise, budget)  
  - Beale function: **Newton’s Method vs. Conjugate Gradient** (trajectories & stability)

- [Homework 3](./Homework%203/)  
  - Linear programming model: **water transfer cost minimization** (formulation, standard form)  
  - Solution approaches: **Simplex** (tableaux) and **CVXPY validation**  
  - **Dual LP** derivation and analysis  
  - Constrained optimization with **Lagrange multipliers** (circle constraint, parameter study)
